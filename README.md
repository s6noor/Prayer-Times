# Prayer-Times
A script to create google calendar events for prayer times

# Google API
All the information regarding connecting to the google api was obtained from:
https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python
https://developers.google.com/calendar/create-events

Code for token and service has been obtained from there as well

Note: the process to get this set up was to follow the first link to set up and obtain the credentials.json file. This file was then moved into my working directory, and the code was run. Once run, token.json will be created and the prayer events will be added to a newly created calendar called "Prayer"

Different ways of extracting prayer times also exists; I choose this method for my own ease
