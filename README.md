# Prayer-Times
A script to create google calendar events for prayer times

# Google API
All the information regarding connecting to the google api was obtained from:
https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python
https://developers.google.com/calendar/create-events

Initial code for token and service has been obtained from there as well

Note: the process to get this set up was to follow the first link to set up and obtain the credentials.json. This file exists on my system with the credentials.
